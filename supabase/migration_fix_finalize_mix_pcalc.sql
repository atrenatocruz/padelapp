-- Fix: 42P01 "relation pcalc does not exist" when finalizing a mix.
--
-- finalize_mix() had TWO separate INSERT statements both trying to read
-- from the `pcalc` CTE — but a WITH-clause CTE only lives inside the ONE
-- statement it's defined in. The first INSERT (into player_stats) closed
-- that statement with its trailing `;`, so `pcalc` no longer existed by
-- the time the second INSERT (into mix_player_stats) tried to read it.
--
-- Fix: chain both INSERTs as data-modifying CTEs inside a single
-- statement, so `pcalc` stays in scope for both. Postgres always executes
-- a data-modifying CTE exactly once, whether or not anything downstream
-- reads its RETURNING output — see the "ins_player_stats" CTE below.
